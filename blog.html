  <p> I am incredibly excited to learn Web Development, as I find it very fascinating. This is my first time learning Web Development, I've never had any prior Web Development experience before. I hope to gain a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of web development in order to learn more advanced topics in the future. My ultimate goal is to become a cloud application developer! 
       </p>


  <p>I will keep updating this blog as this course progresses, as this would serve as a nice memory in the future to look back at! I will later transfer all the contents to my own personal website, with all my details there. Looking forward to a great learning experience in this class.</p>

    For this assignment, I learn how to use CSS. I have to admit, learning CSS has indeed breathed some life and color into my website/blog!
